# Usage

## Synchronizing the translations

To synchronize the translations, run the following command:

```bash copy
npx interflex sync
```

Besides generating the files described in the [quick start section](/quickstart#synchronize-the-translations), the CLI tool will check for changes in your project translations and settings and it will recreate the i18n files with the correct data.

## `interflex.ts` file exports

The `interflex.ts` file exports the following functions:

- `useI18n` - a React hook that can be used to access the translations in your React components (more details in the [`useI18n` section](/usage#usei18n))
- `withInterflex` - a wrapper for your NextJS application that wraps it with the [`InterflexProvider`](/interflex-provider)

It also exports a few types:

- `I18nKey` - a type that represents a translation key
- `I18nVariables` - a type that represents the variables that must be passed to a certain translation
- `I18nLanguage` - a type that represents a language available in your project

## `useI18n`

The `useI18n` hook can be used to access the translations in your React components. It can also be used to change or retrieve the current language of the application.

Here is an example of how to use it:

```tsx copy
import { useI18n } from "interflex";

const Component = () => {
  const { t, locale, changeLocale } = useI18n();

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{t("header")}</h1>
      <p>Current language: {locale}</p>
      <button onClick={() => changeLocale("en")}>Change language</button>
    </div>
  );
};
```

### Translations with variables

If you want to use variables in your translations, you can do so by passing them as the second argument to the `t` function:

```tsx copy
import { useI18n } from "interflex";

const Component = () => {
  const { t } = useI18n();

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{t("greeting", { name: "John" })}<h1>
    </div>
  );
};
```

<Callout type="info">
  Interflex CLI will retrieve the variables that have been configured in the web
  dashboard. It will then generate the correct types for the `t` function. You
  will receive type errors if you try to pass variables that are not defined in
  the web dashboard (or if you don't pass a required variable).
</Callout>
