# Quick Start

This is the fastest way to get your project using Interflex up and running. Before running the commands below, make sure you're in your project's working directory.

For now, Interflex supports only NextJS applications (with app router support coming soon!). Please make sure you are using exactly that.

<Steps>
    ### Install Interflex

    Install the `interflex` package in your project:

    ```bash copy
    npm install interflex
    ```

    ### Sign in to Interflex

    Use the Interflex CLI to sign in to your account:

    ```bash copy
    npx interflex login
    ```

    The command above will open a browser window. You'll have to click the "Authorize" button to sign in. After signing in, you should see a success message in your terminal:

    ```
    âœ” Signed in. You can now use the CLI.
    ```

    <Callout>
        Your session will expire after 90 days. Make sure you sign back in when you start having problems with the CLI.
    </Callout>

    ### Link your project

    Use the Interflex CLI to link your project:

    ```bash copy
    npx interflex link
    ```

    ### Create the `interflex.config.ts` file

    Now, you have to configure Interflex in your app. The config file will tell the CLI how to handle your translations. Please create a file called `interflex.config.ts` in the root of your project and paste the following code:

    ```ts filename="interflex.config.ts" copy
    import { defineConfig } from "interflex";

    export default defineConfig({
        directory: "i18n",
    });
    ```

    The command above will show you a list with all your projects. You will have to select the one you will be using in your app.

    ### Synchronize the translations

    Use the Interflex CLI to synchronize the translations:

    ```bash copy
    npx interflex sync
    ```

    The command above will download all the translations from your project and save them in the directory you specified in the config file. It will create 3 files:
    - `translations.json` - contains all the translations in JSON format
    - `interflex.ts` - exports all the needed types and functions
    - `next-interflex-config.mjs` - contains the `defineNextInterflexConfig` wrapper function

    ### Prepare your app

    Now, you have to prepare your app to use Interflex.

    Firstly, you have to use the config wrapper described above. Rename your `next.config.js` file to `next.config.mjs`. Then, (assuming your directory is called `i18n`) use the wrapper function like that:

    ```js filename="next.config.mjs"
    import defineNextInterflexConfig from "./i18n/next-interflex-config.mjs";

    /** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
    const nextConfig = {
        // ...
    };

    export default defineNextInterflexConfig(nextConfig);
    ```

    After changing the NextJS config file, you have to use the `InterflexProvider` in your app. Wrap your app export with it like that:

    ```tsx filename="_app.tsx"
    import { withInterflex } from "~/i18n/interflex";

    // ...

    export default withInterflex(App);
    ```

    ### You're good to go!

    You can now use the hooks and methods provided by Interflex. For example, you can use the `useI18n` hook:

    ```tsx filename="index.tsx"
    import { useI18n } from "~/i18n/interflex";
    import { type NextPage } from "next";

    const Home: NextPage = () => {
        const { t } = useI18n();

        return (
            <div>
                <h1>{t("hello")}</h1>
            </div>
        );
    }

    export default Home;
    ```

</Steps>
