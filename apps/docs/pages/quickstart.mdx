# Quick Start

This is the fastest way to get your project using Interflex up and running. Before running the commands below, make sure you're in your project's working directory.

For now, Interflex supports only NextJS applications. Please make sure you are using exactly that.

<Steps>
    ### Install Interflex

    Install the `interflex` package in your project:

    ```bash copy
    npm install interflex
    ```

    ### Sign in to Interflex

    Use the Interflex CLI to sign in to your account:

    ```bash copy
    npx interflex login
    ```

    The command above will open a browser window. You'll have to click the "Authorize" button to sign in. After signing in, you should see a success message in your terminal:

    ```
    âœ” Signed in. You can now use the CLI.
    ```

    ### Link your project

    Use the Interflex CLI to link your project:

    ```bash copy
    npx interflex link
    ```

    ### Create the `interflex.config.ts` file

    Now, you have to configure Interflex in your app. The config file will tell the CLI how to handle your translations. Please create a file called `interflex.config.ts` in the root of your project and paste the following code:

    ```ts copy
    import { defineConfig } from "interflex";

    export default defineConfig({
        directory: "i18n",
    });
    ```

    The command above will show you a list with all your projects. You will have to select the one you will be using in your app.

    ### Synchronize the translations

    Use the Interflex CLI to synchronize the translations:

    ```bash copy
    npx interflex sync
    ```
